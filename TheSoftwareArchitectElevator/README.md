# The Software Architect Elevator

Architect live in the system's first derivative: the mathematical expression for how quickly a function's value changes. Architecture has value in parts of the system that need to adapt to frequent changes.

Designing for the first derivative (ratio of change):
- **Dependencies**: the more dependencies, the less change can accept a system
- **Friction**: how easy is to modify and deploy a system impacts how much change can it accept
- **Poor quality**: change is slower in poorly tested systems.
- **Fear**: how confident is the team to make changes impacts the speed of change

An architect has three main attributes:
- **skills**: has tools and knows the drill
- **impact**: rational and disciplined decision taking
- **leadership**: sharing of knowledge, be known, giving a talk, writing a paper

For **making decisions** is important to be disciplined. Avoid: 
- the **law of small numbers**, as we tend to extract conclusions from non representative sets of data.
- **confirmation bias**, we interpret data in a way that validates our previous opinion.
- **prospect theory**: if you offer to pay 120 for heads in a coin toss, make the other person pay 100 in the other case, most people will decline when it is objectively good.
- **priming**: we tend to mix our thinking with recent data we received. A sales man will offer a very expensive car just to make the next car more acceptable.

When making decisions one important goal is not making software irreversible. So avoid making decisions until the last responsible time.

Also question everything. Use the five whys to understand the root of your analysis and spot hidden assuptions.  Like the Oracle in Matrix: "You did not came here to make a choice, you have already made it. You are here to try to understand why you made it".
